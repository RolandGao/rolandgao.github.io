experimental iteration. but the level of iteration matters. 
evals, identifying gaps in the eval results and try to close the gap.

eval is the most important. If the eval is wrong, then all the effort on trying to close the gap on the eval goes to waste.

the people doing the evals should also be the people imrpoving the model results. They understand the problem space the most. 

If you can evaluate, then you can do RL. One problem is that we might know which output is better but not how to reliably produce the better result. For example, we can evaluate movies but we can't make good movies reliably. If evaluation needs humans, then RL might not be scalable
