Sleep
sleeo helps maintain balance: physical repair, immune function, emotional regulation, metabolism, heart health, learning, reaction time, fine motor control. chronic short sleep increases risks for depression, accidents, metabolic disease, and heart problems.

7-9 hours. 6 is not enough. 
how to have good sleep. 
1. stable temperature
2. no light during sleep
3. consistent sleep and wake time
4. no caffeine or alcohol. matcha, tea, cola, and chocolate have caffeine. 
5. no food a few hours before bed
6. exercise
7. wind down routine

# TODO: One cycle is 90 minutes, but one dream is 30 min and i woke up after the dream, so how does that work. 

## Exercise
80% Zone 2 exercise. 20% higher zone exercise
VO2 max


## Diet
protein

### alcohol
if possible, don’t ever drink alcohol. if someone asks you to drink, you can refuse. practice refusing so that you can comfortably refuse when they actually ask. 
alcohol harms the brain, heart, and stomach. it is especially harmful when you are on an empty stoch, dehydrated, or sleep deprived. 
alcohol takes up to 3 days to recover. when still recovering, do not exercise. 

### coffee
adenosine builds up during the day to make you feel sleepy. caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors from connecting with the adenosine. 
with regular use, tolerance develops. when you stop, withdrawal can bring sleepiness and headaches. 
the theory of shifting baseline. 
causes heart problems, irritability, and anxiety. similar effect to stress, boosts adrenaline and noradrenaline. 

No caffeine
Caffeine is in coffee, tea, oolong tea, iced tea, matcha, chocolate, energy drink, coca cola.

## Friends
rate your happiness for each social interaction. understand what kinds of social interactions make you happy and what kinds don't

Spend quality time with loved ones and friends.

## Productivity
nap 20 min in the afternoon. Avoid napping after 5pm cuz it might disrupt sleep


Use time-blocking: Dedicate specific hours or days for your research project, ensuring you protect your time for work and rest.

Schedule your most demanding tasks during your peak productivity hours.

baseline sympathetic tone. aka baseline stress level. the lower the better. if baseline stress level is already high, then when you actually need to lock in, you can’t. 



## Avoid radiation
CT scan’s effect on the thyroid
CT scans for the chest, head, and neck expose thyroid to radiation, increasing the risk of thyroid cancer. 
if contrast dye is iodinated contrast, then you’re extra fucked. 

pet scan??

# health system
## health insurance
company insurance > covered california > medi-cal
company insurance is Group insurance while the other ones are Individual insurance.
Without company insurance, you get a narrower network. the most prestigious hospitals usually get dropped to save cost. 
the way to have company-grade insurance after retiring is to found a startup and hire at least one employee who’s not your spouse. then get the insurance through your startup. Use PEO Justworks for Large Group, or Blue Shield Small Group. 

PPO: highest cost, PCP not required, partial coverage for out of network
HMO: lowest cost, PCP required, zero coverage out of network
POS: PCP required, expensive partial coverage for out of ntetwork
EPO: PCP not required, zero coverage out of network
HDHP + HSA: like PPO but higher deductibles. HSA is a tax-free account that can pay for medical expenses. 

For PCP, Choose MD / DO over NP / PA for PCP. MD / DO have 15000+ hours of clinical trainng while NP / PA have only 1000-3000 hours. First appointment (new patient) could have 3 months wait, but the second appointment (established patient) is usually same day or next day. 

## metabolism
can glucose turn into fat and can fat turn into glucose?
glucose can turn into both fatty acid and glycerol, eventually turning into trigyceride. glycerol can turn back into glucose but fatty acid cannot. it’s a one way street. 

brain uses 120g of glucose a day. 5g per hour. 
glycogen store: liver 100g, muscle 400g

visceral fat (belly fat) is bad while subcutaneous fat (limb fat) is fine. visceral fat is burned first, so exercise helps. 

# LDL
soluble fiber binds to bile acid (made from cholesterol). without soluble fiber, the bodyu reabsorbs those bile acids and LDL rises.

## sunscreen
apply a lot of sunscreen. reapply every 2 hours outside cuz the sunscreen can be physically removed by touch, sweat. 
UVB burns while UVA causes aging and cancer. your senses can perceive UVB better than UVA. 
UVA damage is cumulative. be careful of reflections. snow can double the UV damage. dark skin has 13 SPF while white skin has 3 SPF. 

SPF 30 means 30 times the protection compared to no protection

# Working long hours is bad for health



# heart
Here are the updated tables, now including **ApoB / LDL** in the Medical Markers section.

While standard LDL (Low-Density Lipoprotein) measures the *amount of cholesterol* inside your fat particles, **ApoB (Apolipoprotein B)** measures the actual *number of plaque-building particles* in your blood. Because of this, modern cardiology increasingly views ApoB as the superior and more accurate predictor of heart disease.

### Table 1: Modifiable Lifestyle, Environmental & Psychosocial Factors

*Factors you can directly influence through behavior, diet, or environment.*

| Category | Factor | Statistical Risk Impact (Approx.) | Key Mechanism / Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Habits** | **Smoking** | **+200% to +300%** (Risk) | Damage to lining of arteries; single biggest preventable cause. |
| **Habits** | **Alcohol (Heavy)** | **+40% to +100%** (Risk) | Heavy drinking raises BP and risks cardiomyopathy/arrhythmia. |
| **Habits** | **Alcohol (Moderate)** | **Variable** (-9% vs +Risk) | **Controversial.** Some data shows slight benefit; newer WHO guidance says *no* amount is "safe" due to cancer/BP risks. |
| **Habits** | **Physical Inactivity** | **+20% to +30%** (Risk) | Comparable to smoking; causes stiffness in arteries. |
| **Diet** | **Poor Diet** (Low F&V) | **+30%** (Risk) | Lack of protective antioxidants and fiber. |
| **Diet** | **Hydration** (Water) | **-46% to -59%** (Benefit) | 5+ glasses/day lowers blood viscosity (thickness). |
| **Diet** | **Hydration** (Sugary) | **+46% to +147%** (Risk) | High glycemic load spikes insulin and inflammation. |

| **Medical** | **Lipoprotein(a)** | **+100% to +200%** (Risk) | Genetic "sticky" cholesterol; affects ~20% of population. |
| **Medical** | **Hypertension** | **+18% PAR** (Risk) | High pressure physically damages artery walls over time. |
| **Medical** | **Abdominal Obesity** | **+50% to +100%** (Risk) | Visceral fat is metabolically active and inflammatory. |
| **Medical** | **Erectile Dysfunction** | **+50%** (Risk) | "Canary in the coal mine"; vascular issues show here first. |
| **Medical** | **Flu Infection** | **+500%** (Acute Risk) | 6x risk in the week following infection due to plaque inflammation. |
| **History** | **Adverse Childhood Exp.** | **+50% to +100%** (Risk) | Early trauma rewires the nervous system (toxic stress). |

| **Biology** | **Grip Strength** | **-17% per 11lb** (Benefit) | Stronger grip correlates with overall lower frailty/risk. |
| **Biology** | **Age** | **Significant Increase** | Risk doubles roughly every decade after 55. |
| **Biology** | **Gender** | **Variable** | Men at risk 10 years earlier; women catch up post-menopause. |
| **Biology** | **Ethnicity** | **Variable** | S. Asians/African Americans have higher genetic predisposition. |
