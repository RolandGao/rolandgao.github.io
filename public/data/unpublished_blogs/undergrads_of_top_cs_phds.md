# Where did the top CS PhDs attend their undergrads? 

Having a good undergrad CS education is important if one wants to go to a top CS PhD program. So which universities send the most students to top CS PhD programs anyways? 

In 2020, someone on reddit manually checked the undergrad universities for all Stanford CS PhDs and compiled the results in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i3ve2e/d_universities_attended_by_cs_phd_students_at/). 

Many things have changed over the past 5 years. ChatGPT came out in 2022 and took the world by storm. A CS PhD now is much more likely to conduct AI research than 5 years ago. Covid hit in 2020 and different universities handled it differently, potentially influencing the career outcomes of the students. 

So now in 2025, I plan to collect the statistics again and see what's changed. Different from the redditor 5 years ago, I used ChatGPT to collect and analyze the data for me instead of me manually searching up all the data.
