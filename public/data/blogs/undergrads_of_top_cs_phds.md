A strong undergraduate CS education is important for getting into a top CS PhD program. So which universities send the most students to these programs?

In 2020, someone on Reddit manually checked the undergraduate institutions for all Stanford CS PhD students and compiled the results in a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i3ve2e/d_universities_attended_by_cs_phd_students_at/).

A lot has changed over the past five years. ChatGPT launched in 2022 and took the world by storm. CS PhD students are more likely to conduct AI research now than they were five years ago. COVID-19 hit in 2020, and universities handled it differently, potentially influencing students’ career outcomes.

So in 2025, I collected the statistics again to see what’s changed. Unlike the Redditor five years ago, I used ChatGPT to collect and analyze the data rather than manually looking everything up.

## Stanford CS PhD

There are 338 Stanford CS PhD students in total. ChatGPT found undergraduate institutions for 328 of them, and I manually found six more. Only four remain unknown.
Below are all undergraduate institutions with at least three students (30 total).

Compared to [5 years ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/i3ve2e/d_universities_attended_by_cs_phd_students_at/), The number of students from the following universities more than doubled: Cornell University, UC San Diego, University of Washington.

## How about CS PhDs at other universities?

MIT, Berkeley, and CMU do not publish consolidated lists of all their CS PhD students. As such, statistics for those universities will be left for future work.
